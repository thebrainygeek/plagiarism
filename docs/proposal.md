## Summary

get the final minecraft board/scenario and built it

## AI/ML Algorithms

norvig

getNextBlock checks if you can't reach anything

learns over time for which block in which order needs to be placed

## Evaluation

only counting number of blocks placed

## Extra Notes
once correct can blocks be changed?
