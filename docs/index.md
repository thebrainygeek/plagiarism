# Plagiarism

The goal of the Plagiarism project is to construct the minecraft structure provided as input while minimising the distance traveled to construct it. A brute-force/random solution to the problem would involve the agent travelling between blocks in an inefficient and time consuming order. Our goal is to use known Graph Algorithms to find the best route for the agent to follow.
