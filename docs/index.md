# Plagiarism

The goal of the Plagiarism project is to automatically construct a building with the least amount of distance traveled.

![Large sample house](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thebrainygeek/plagiarism/master/docs/images/minecraft_big_house.jpg)

The more detailed version of this is included in the other tabs of the site, but basically: 
- A structure's data is passed to the agent.
- The agent determines the order of the blocks that should be placed to reduce the length of the agent traveled as it is building the structure
