# Plagiarism

This is the project for the Plagiarism project, based off Malmo-Minecraft fro UCI's CS175 AI project!

The goal of the Plagiarism project is to automatically construct the building with the most efficient way.

The more detailed version of this is included in the Status section of the site, but basically: 
- A structure's data is passed to the agent.
- Agent will build it with the most efficient way after tring hundred or thousands of times.
